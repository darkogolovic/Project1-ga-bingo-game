## 🕹️ Getting Started
- Welcome to the Lucky Draw Game! The goal is simple:
    pick 6 numbers and see if luck is on your side as the
    machine draws random balls. Match all your numbers to win big!
- Select 6 numbers from the number grid.
- You can choose numbers manually, by color, or randomly.
- Each number has a specific color — it helps identify patterns.
- Once you select 6 numbers and **Set bet Amount**, the **Start Game** button becomes active.
- The game will then draw up to 35 random balls.
- If your chosen numbers appear among the drawn balls, you win!
- Each win has a multiplier that boosts your earnings.
